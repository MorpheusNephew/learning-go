You have been asked to manage a basketball league and are going to write a program to help you.
Define two types.
The first one, called `Team`, has a field for the name of the team and a field for the player names.
The second type is called `League` and has a field called `Teams` for the teams in the league
and a field called `Wins` that maps a teamâ€™s name to its number of wins.
